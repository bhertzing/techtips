In addition, there are a large variety of phenomena that are driven by the variability of the sun over periods ranging from hours to years.

I am trying to find the purpose for this site. It maps out any place on the globe with three words. Esentially, it has divided the entire Earth in a grid and given a three word assignment to each square.
For example: The Eiffel Tower is at prices.slippery.traps (Which is actually funny considering all the commerce around the landmark.)
Other site examples:
Eiffel Tower: ///prices.slippery.traps
Trevi Fountain: ///received.switch.repeats
Wrigly Field: ///flops.</description>
