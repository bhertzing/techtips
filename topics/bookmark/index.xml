Space Weather impacts numerous facets of everyday life, from where airplanes can safely fly, to how accurately a farmer plows his field. In addition, there are a large variety of phenomena that are driven by the variability of the sun over periods ranging from hours to years. SWPC provides information for novices and experts alike about the impacts and phenomena of Space Weather.

I am trying to find the purpose for this site. It maps out any place on the globe with three words. Esentially, it has divided the entire Earth in a grid and given a three word assignment to each square.
For example: The Eiffel Tower is at prices.slippery.traps (Which is actually funny considering all the commerce around the landmark.)
Other site examples:
Eiffel Tower: ///prices.slippery.traps
Trevi Fountain: ///received.switch.repeats
Wrigly Field: ///flops.</description>

I like using this site to come up with creative names. It will combine the beginning or ending of a given word with other matching words in the dictionary.
Example: travel + velocity = travelocity</description>
